= SÃ©bastien Lahaie---Mentoring

I have been fortunate to work with many outstanding students over their summer internships at Yahoo and Microsoft. If you are interested in working with me, send me an [slahaie@microsoft.com email] and also be sure to fill in an application (including reference letters) through Microsoft's [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/jobs/intern/apply.aspx online system]. Applications are usually received by December and selections are made by the following February.
